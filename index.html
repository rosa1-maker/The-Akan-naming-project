            The Akan people of Ghana name children after the day of the week they were born and the order in which they
            were born. These "day names"
            have further meanings concerning the soul and character of the person. Middle names have considerably more
            variety and can refer to their birth order, twin status, or an ancestor's middle name.
        </p>
        <p>This system helps you key your dates of birth in order to find out which day of the week you were born
            according your date of birth and the name as well</p>
